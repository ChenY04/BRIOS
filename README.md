# BRIOS
A new deep learning-based model (BRIOS) for reconstructing high-quality NDVI time-series data in heavily cloudy areas：fusion of Sentinel 1 and 2 data

* We shared our work on reconstructing NDVI time series using a SAR-optical fusion deep learning model. 
* Brief introduction to BRIOS：
   In this study, we developed a new Bidirectional Recurrent Imputation for Optical-SAR fusion (BRIOS) model to reconstruct high-quality Sentinel-2 NDVI time series data. BRIOS designs a two-layer recurrent architecture that handles deep features from discrete, cloud-free NDVI observations and SAR data more effectively and makes the SAR-NDVI relationship more stable. BRIOS has been well evaluted on three full Sentinel-2 tiles with different land covers.
* The test dataset and more detailed usage instructions will be updated in succession.
